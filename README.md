This repository contains a simple C program demonstrating a potential error when using pointers. The program shows how modifying a variable's value through a pointer can lead to unexpected results if not handled carefully. The solution demonstrates safe pointer usage and memory management.  The file 'bug.c' contains the code with the error, and 'bugSolution.c' provides a corrected version.
